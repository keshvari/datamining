# Data Mining Example
I have enrolled a great specialization  at [Coursera](http://coursera.com/ "Coursera") named [Data Mining](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/datamining "Data Mining")
by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I have enrolled a lot course in the Coursera but never complete each of them, so I have promised myself to
stick courses in this specialization. In my opinion the best way to complete a course is solving exercises.
I am going to solve all exercises and implement they in JavaScript language and mongodb (if needed).
I have deployed this repository on Heroku
